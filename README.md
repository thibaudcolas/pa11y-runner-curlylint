> Pa11y runner for HTML linting with [curlylint](https://github.com/thibaudcolas/curlylint).

## Usage

> ðŸš§ Currently the runner is only compatible with PR [#524 â€“Â Add lower-level runner API to support non-browser runners](https://github.com/pa11y/pa11y/pull/524), and on my fork [thibaudcolas/pa11y#feature/node-runners](https://github.com/thibaudcolas/pa11y#feature/node-runners).

**curlylint first needs to be installed separately.** Then,

```sh
npm install -g https://github.com/thibaudcolas/pa11y#feature/node-runners pa11y-runner-curlylint
```

With `curlylint`, Pa11y, and the runner installed,

```sh
pa11y --runner curlylint https://www.example.com/
```

## Why

curlylint isnâ€™t an accessibility checker like other Pa11y runners â€“ itâ€™s a general-purpose templates linter. Nonetheless, it contains linting rules that are related to accessibility, and code smell rules that can help maintain codebases.
