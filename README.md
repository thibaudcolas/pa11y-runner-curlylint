> Pa11y runner for HTML validation with the [Nu Html Checker (v.Nu)](https://validator.github.io/validator/).

## Usage

**To use the runner, first install [`vnu`](https://validator.github.io/validator/).**

> ðŸš§ Currently the Runner is only compatible with https://github.com/thibaudcolas/pa11y.

```sh
# On macOS,
brew install vnu
# Elsewhere, grab the latest release from
# https://github.com/validator/validator/releases/latest.
# Make sure the `vnu` executable is in your PATH.
# Then,
npm install -g https://github.com/thibaudcolas/pa11y#feature/node-runners pa11y-runner-vnu
```

With `vnu`, Pa11y, and the runner installed,

```sh
pa11y --runner vnu https://www.example.com/
```
